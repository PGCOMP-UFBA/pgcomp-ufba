A new powerful and flexible organization of documents can be obtained by mixing fuzzy and possibilistic clustering, in which documents can belong to more than one cluster simultaneously with different compatibility degrees with a particular topic. The topics are represented by clusters and the clusters are identified by one or more descriptors extracted by a proposed method. We aim to investigate whether the descriptors extracted after fuzzy and possibilistic clustering improves the flexible organization of documents. Experiments were carried using a collection of documents and we evaluated the descriptors ability to capture the essential information of the used collection. The results prove that the fuzzy possibilistic clusters descriptors extraction is effective and can improve the flexible organization of documents.
